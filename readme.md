## Description ##

It can be a hassle to fill out your billing address if you aren't actually paying any money. This plugin removes the billing address fields from WooCommerce checkout when the cart total is 0, ie: Free. 

Specifically the following fields are removed:

1. billing_address_1
1. billing_address_2
1. billing_city
1. billing_state
1. billing_postcode
1. billing_country
1. billing_phone

That's it!

### Support ###

Before posting a question, please confirm that the problem still exists with a default theme and with all other plugins disabled.
