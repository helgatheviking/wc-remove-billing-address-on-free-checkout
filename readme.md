# Remove WooCommerce Billing Address Fields for Free Checkout #

It can be a hassle to fill out your billing address if you aren't actually paying any money. This plugin removes the billing address fields from WooCommerce checkout when no shipping is required and the cart total is 0, ie: Free. 

Specifically the following fields are removed:

1. billing_address_1
1. billing_address_2
1. billing_city
1. billing_state
1. billing_postcode
1. billing_country
1. billing_phone

That's it!
